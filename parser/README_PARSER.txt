This parser is intended to get data from participants.db. Get the data in the following procedure:

1. Open the terminal and type:
    python parser.py <path to your participants.db>

2. The data will be stored in experiment_data/, which should be a folder generated by parser.py. The data files are named by convention: assignmentID_workerID_hitID_{doublet, subject, triplet}. In other words, each experiment data generated by a worker will be splitter into three files. The format of each file is as follows:

Doublet Data:
Column 1: worker counter (indicate the sequence of the worker taking the experiment)
Column 2: assignment ID
Column 3: worker ID
Column 4: hit ID
Column 5: trial type
	    0   instruction 
	    1   practice
	    2   actual trial
	    3   catchy question
Column 6: set number
Column 7: react_time (in ms)
Column 8: similarity score
	  for catchy question:
	  	true   means the subject provides the correct answer
		false   otherwise
	  for actual trial question:
		1   maximally dissimilar
		9   maximally similar
Column 9 & 10: two stimuli (image index)


Triplet Data:
Column 1: worker counter (indicate the sequence of the worker taking the experiment)
Column 2: assignment ID
Column 3: worker ID
Column 4: hit ID
Column 5: trial type
	    0   instruction 
	    1   practice
	    2   actual trial
	    3   catchy question
Column 6: set number
Column 7: react_time (in ms)
Column 8 & 9: two images pressed by worker(image index) 
column 10 & 11: the location of two images above
	    0   top 
	    1   left
	    2   right
Column 12, 13 & 14: three stimuli (image index)

Subject Data:
Column 1: worker counter (indicate the sequence of the worker taking the experiment)
Column 2: assignment ID
Column 3: worker ID
Column 4: hit ID
Column 5: age
Column 6: gender

	1   Female 
	2   Male
Column 7: sexual orientation
