        <p> Welcome to the face similarity judgment task.</p>

        <p>Results from this study will help us better understand how human brain perceive face similarity. </p>

        <p>We hope that you enjoy this task. Let's start! :) </p>

        <hr>

        <p>By clicking “I agree” below you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form and agree to participate in this research study.  You may print a copy of this page for your records.</p>

        <!--<p><b>Why are you doing this research?</b><br/>
        We want to understand the way the human brain helps us understand the faces.  More specifically, we want to know the way we measure the similarities between faces.  </p> 

        <p><b>What will I have to do?</b><br/>
        We will be asking you to pay attention to face images on your computer screen.  We will also ask you to make responses using your keyboard or your mouse.
        You will receive more specific instructions shortly.</p>

        <p><b>How long will this experiment take?</b><br/>
        This experiment will take about 30  minutes.</p> 

        <p><b>Are there are any risks?</b><br/> 
        We do not expect there to be any risks.  For questions of a very private nature that might make you feel uncomfortable, you have the option to skip that question or decline to respond. You are also free to end the experiment at any time by closing your browser window.  </p>-->
        
        <!-- <p><b>What do I get out of it?</b><br/>
        We will give you feedback on how you did when you finish the experiment. We will also tell you how you compare with other people who did this experiment.
        We will also explain what we hope to learn from this research.  The final results from this experiment will be posted on the Results page.</p> -->

        <!--<p><b>Will I get paid?</b><br/>
        Yes, in compensation for your time you will be provided a $0.50 payment by Amazon.com.</p>
        
        <p><b>Will you share my information with other people?</b><br/>
        To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential. We will minimize any risks to breach of confidentiality by keeping your responses completely separate from your worker ID, and researchers will not have access to your worker ID. Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law and may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board. </p>
